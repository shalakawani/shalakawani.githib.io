    <h2>2 Pizzas, 67 Songs, and a Weekend</h2>
    <p>
       The world of Generative AI ignited my imagination in class. Watching someone craft a product ad in minutes made me wonder – could I build my own website?  The challenge: I had zero coding experience, a weekend packed with exams, and a mountain of assignments. But, I was determined to try.

        I spent the entire weekend glued to my chair. I treated this like a high-stakes project, breaking it down into manageable pieces. First, I had to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ChatGPT became my indispensable AI tutor, explaining concepts, debugging my code, and even offering design tips. I set mini-deadlines, constantly iterating and improving.

        There were frustrating moments when code wouldn't work or designs looked wonky. But seeing my ideas take shape kept me going. After 2 pizzas, multiple loops of playlist of 67 songs, a lot of web surfing, sitting on a chair the entire weekend, this website was born. It might not be flawless, but it's proof of what you can achieve with AI as your guide and a project management mindset focused on the finish line.

          <h3>Seattle's Sustainable Stride: Visualizing Recycling and Waste Trends</h3>
          <p> I developed an insightful Tableau dashboard that serves as a key tool for communicating the progress and challenges in the city’s residential recycling and waste prevention efforts. The primary aim was to craft visualizations that answer pivotal questions regarding Seattle's recycling goals, the impact of population growth on waste production, and trends in per capita recycling and waste disposal. This dashboard not only serves the immediate needs of the City of Seattle but also acts as a model for other municipalities striving to enhance their environmental programs through data-driven strategies. It reflects a commitment to sustainability and transparency, encouraging public engagement and informed decision-making.</p>
